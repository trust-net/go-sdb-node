Software Defined Blockchain Node Implementation

# Introduction
Software defined blockchain is a private blockchain network that is created dynamically by the application. Such a network has two types of network nodes:
* **peer nodes**: provide fault tolerance for consensus and application level business logic of the private blockchain network.
* **witness nodes**: provide de-centralized and censor-free network security towards fault tolerance for non-repudiation and non-alterability properties of the private blockchain network.

In general, setting up a private blockchain using traditional blockchain technologies takes considerable time and effort. This implementation aims to use DLT Stack model, to create/manage private blockchain networks on the fly.
